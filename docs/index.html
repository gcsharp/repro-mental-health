<h2>Module convener</h2>
<p>I’m <a
href="https://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Gemma_Sharp">Dr
Gemma Sharp</a> and I’m your module convenor for Women’s Reproductive
Mental Health. I’m passionate about lots of things, but chiefly women’s
health, research, data, and cats, so I’m very glad that I get to teach
this module (although it is a bit light on cats tbh).</p>
</div>
<div id="keeping-in-touch" class="section level2">
<h2>Keeping in touch</h2>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to talk to me before, during or after the
Tuesday teaching sessions if you have anything you’d like to discuss in
private. You can also email me (g.c.sharp) about anything related to
your personal circumstances.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss something practical that might help other
students too (e.g. “Where do I find xxx?”, “When is the essay due?”,
etc), then please post your question on our [Teams] channel. This is
also the right place to discuss or share material relevant to the
content of the course.</p>

<h2>Course structure</h2>
<div id="tuesday-3-hour-sessions" class="section level3">
<h3>Tuesday 3 hour sessions</h3>
<p>Each week, the 3 hours timetabled on a Tuesday will consist of a
mixture of lecture style delivery and class/group discussions and
activities about key aspects of that week’s topic. This will all be
in-person.</p>
</div>
<div id="outside-of-session-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Outside-of-session materials</h3>
<p>Each week there will be required and optional materials (reading,
videos, podcasts, and activities) for you to engage with for each topic.
You should be spending about 1.5-2 hours per week on this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Required pre-session material</strong> - I expect the
required reading/viewing/activities to be done prior to the Tuesday
session, as aspects of the material will be discussed during class.
Bring materials and any notes along with you to the Tuesday session.</p>
<p><strong>Optional material</strong> - The optional/suggested reading
is a chance for you to not only consolidate the information from the
Tuesday session, but to explore areas of the week’s topic that may not
necessarily be covered in the session. I encourage you to go beyond the
reading lists and read on aspects of the topic you are interested
in.</p>
<p>If there are things you would like to know more about and they are
not mentioned in the lecture or covered by the optional reading, please
let me know! Feel free to share with your coursemates too, via
Teams.</p>

<div id="a-focus-on-research-and-evidence" class="section level2">
<h2>A focus on research and evidence</h2>
<p>The Scientist Practitioner Model (Shapiro, 2002) means using science
to inform clinical practice, and vice versa. Clinical practice is
therefore “scientifically-informed” or “evidence-based”. In this module,
we will be developing the skills clinical psychologists need to take a
scientifically informed viewpoint. For those of us who aren’t planning
to work clinically, we’ll be developing the skills needed to pursue
research that can (eventually) inform clinical guidelines. Therefore, we
could all benefit from doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing the world (and especially your own assumptions and beliefs)
critically and curiously. If you think something might be true, don’t be
afraid of being wrong, and in fact, seek out the evidence to prove that
you are. Test rather than blindly reinforce hypotheses.</li>
<li>Understanding what constitutes “good” data/research and what
constitutes less “good” data/research and then applying those standards
to the evidence you’re working with.</li>
<li>Understanding that “evidence informed practice” isn’t always just
about trial evidence, it’s also about experimental and epidemiological
evidence about core processes and mechanisms in human emotion and
behaviour that help to explain mental health problems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="pedagogical-teaching-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Pedagogical (Teaching) Approach</h2>
<p>This module aims not only to teach you core content, but also to help
you apply a lot of the critical thinking skills you have been learning
for the past 2+ years. It aims to help you consolidate and synthesise
this knowledge in new ways to understand and describe complex ideas.</p>
<p>You may be used to lectures and text heavy powerpoint slides. You may
think that these are great because they guide you through a topic in a
structured fashion and you feel secure that you have all the material
you’ll need for the exam. The bad news is that this approach facilitates
<em>passive</em> learning only, and has been demonstrated to reduce
actual long-term learning. The good news is that this course instead
encourages you to take an <em>active</em> learning approach, and this is
associated with longer-term and more effective learning.</p>
<p>You will still have written learning materials, but these are
intended as only broad guides to help organise the seminar structure
(accepting that we will be flexible with the structure some weeks - if
we get into a really juicy debate about something engaging, we might
stick with that rather than rushing through the remaining slides for the
sake of it). The focus will be much more on encouraging you to organise
the material for yourselves, to sort through what is and isn’t
important, to reflect on the content, to manipulate knowledge, and to
apply it.</p>
<p>The teaching and leadning activities used in this module will be
varied. Sometimes we will focus primarily on lecture and discussions.
Sometimes the session will be organised around small group learning
tasks, which will then be shared with the rest of the group.</p>
<div id="example-teaching-and-learning-activities"
class="section level3">
<h3>Example teaching and learning activities</h3>
<p>The teaching and learning activities that you engage with throughout
this module are designed to develop your skills in critical thinking,
synthesis of ideas, and (persuasive) communication. These skills will be
helpful for the assessments, but they are also transferable skills that
can help in your life and work beyond university.</p>
<p>In all cases, you will find it useful to make notes and to contribute
to the discussions and group work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video lecture:</strong> a lecture recorded by me or someone
else for you to watch before coming to the Tuesday session. These are
usually designed to give a broad overview of a topic or to explain a
concept that will be fundamental to your understanding of the
topic.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific paper reading:</strong> a paper for you to read
and digest prior to coming to the Tuesday session. You might be asked
just to read and try to understand, or to critically appraise the paper
(i.e. comment on its strengths and weaknesses).</li>
<li><strong>Online article reading:</strong> sometimes, you will be
asked to read online articles written by or for non-scientists. These
are sometimes useful for providing a general overview or a different
perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Online video:</strong> there are some brilliant videos
online that can provide clear, concise introductions to basic concepts.
Sometimes I will point you to these to watch before coming to a session.
There are also excellent videos online that can help you hear from and
consider different perspectives, including the perspectives of
patients.</li>
<li><strong>Group discussion:</strong> either in small groups or
sometimes as part of the whole class, I will guide a discussion around a
topic. It can help to talk through ideas as a group and listen to the
ideas and perspectives of others.</li>
<li><strong>Debate:</strong> you will be put into two (or more) groups
and asked to come up with an argument for or against a statement. The
groups will then take it in turns to present their arguments and respond
to each other.</li>
<li><strong>Research sandpit:</strong> emulating working in an
interdisciplinary research team, you will work in a group to design a
research study to address a specific research question.</li>
<li><strong>Group presentation:</strong> you will work in small groups
to research a topic, synthesise an argument or narrative and then
present to the rest of the class. This is excellent preparation for
essay writing. The presentation itself might take the form of a lecture,
poster or infographic.</li>
<li><strong>Quiz:</strong> quizzes can be useful for checking your
understanding of basic (fact-based) information. It can sometimes be a
confidence boost for the exam to know that you are retaining and can
recall this kind of information.</li>

<div id="expectations-for-class-behaviour" class="section level1">
<h1>Expectations for class behaviour</h1>
<div id="be-nice" class="section level3">
<h3>Be nice</h3>
<p>We are all adults and we should treat each other accordingly.
Therefore we can expect to work in an environment that supports mutual
respect and thoughtfulness. As a general rule, if you ever feel critical
of another person, please try to put yourself in that person’s shoes for
a moment. Use what you learn from that to inform your perspective, and
then act accordingly. In all interactions (including with me), look for
ways to balance responsibility and to arrive at mutually beneficial,
practical, and solution-focused outcomes are typically the best way
forwards. See the advice on group work below.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-the-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Do the work</h3>
<p>Please engage with the pre-session materials before coming to the
Tuesday sessions. Often, there will be group learning tasks where you
will need to build on the pre-session material in class. If you have not
looked at it, you will be letting your group down.</p>
<p>During the sessions, please try to contribute to the discussions. I
know that ‘group work’ and ‘presentations’ may sound like horrifying
experiences to some. I really do empathise, but you will get so much
more out of this module if you engage with these sessions. See the
advice on group work below (you don’t have to be a super confident
extrovert to excel in group work).</p>
</div>
<div id="turn-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Turn up</h3>
<p>We do not require attendance, although we highly encourage it. This
is your investment and you will get as much out of it as you put into
it. Although you’ll get some written material, these are just intended
to support your learning, and the main content of what is taught will be
in the Tuesday sessions. The readings and powerpoints will not be enough

<h2>Reading and making notes</h2>
<p>This video explains why it’s important to read scientific papers, how
they’re structured, and one approach to reading papers that you might
find useful:</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>Reading learning content with a goal is always more effective. Make
notes as you’re reading, and try to get a sense of the main
points/arguments of the article. What is this article trying to say? If
you had to explain the main point of the article in three sentences to a
non-psychology family member, what would you say?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Be able to critique the detail of the article.</strong>
Given the main points of the article, what evidence do the authors
present to support their argument/points? Is the evidence good evidence?
Why or why not? Sometimes it may be that the logic of leading to their
hypotheses are weak. Sometimes it may be that the
design/methods/statistics are weak and/or lacking. Sometimes their
conclusions may leave a lot of questions unanswered. Write down 2-3 main
critiques (these could be criticisms or praise) for the
article.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthesise!</strong> There are three primary synthesis
challenges in this module:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Synthesising links between the readings for <em>each topic</em>
(i.e., each week): Are there any common threads between the articles?
Does one article inform another article? (e.g., does an article about
effects of estradiol on depression inform findings from another article
about the link between menopause and mental health?) State 1 or 2 ways
that the articles inform each other.</li>
<li>Synthesising links between each reading and <em>the overall
course</em>: This is a course about women’s mental health, but not all
the articles will necessarily be directly about women’s mental health.
It doesn’t mean that it doesn’t pertain to women’s mental health, and
one of the challenges of the course will be applying material to women’s
mental health. For each article, state at least one way it pertains to
women’s mental health. OR, find a theme for the articles for the week
and state how that theme pertains to women’s mental health.</li>
<li>Synthesising links <em>between topics</em> (i.e. between weeks):
think about how the readings for each week pertain to topics from
previous weeks. Are there any links? Where you notice this, write it
down!</li>
</ol></li>

<div id="working-in-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Working in groups</h2>
<p>Everyone has a style. Our styles may be determined in part by our
thresholds and tolerance for anxiety/distress, our drive for and
experience of pleasure/reward, our inhibitory style/capability, our
preferences for routine or for novelty, amongst other things. For each
person, where we fall along these continua will be both a strength and a
weakness, depending on what the context/situation demands of an
individual at any given moment. Please keep that in mind. There is no
one way of being that is, at all times, superior to another way of
being.</p>
<div class="warning"
style="padding:1.0em; background-color:seashell; color:#cd5b45">
<details>

</summary>
<p>Being organised and getting things done quickly can be a real
strength. Sometimes individuals with these styles will describe feeling
a sense of pressure and some anxiety straight away when tasks are
provided. Thus, getting things done quickly, and having a good plan for
getting them done can help to relieve this pressure and anxiety, and can
also provide these individuals with a sense of accomplishment and
reward. All of these things are positives in many contexts. At the same
time, though, there are contexts where it is better to wait and get more
information, to sit and tolerate and accept uncertainty, to throw out
rule books and approach situations from novel perspectives. There are
also situations where there are many things to do, and it is not
possible to get everything done in a quick and timely fashion. These
individuals can struggle to meet the demands of those kinds of
situations and that can produce stress and anxiety for them.</p>
<p>Other individuals may have a style that has a high tolerance for
anxiety, openness to new experiences and sensitivity to reward. Those
individuals may be flexible to contextual demands, creative in their
thinking, and willing (and even excited) to take on challenges. Our
society (and science!) has certainly benefited from creative and novel
approaches and individuals who were willing to take chances and to dive
into uncharted territory. However, those individuals may not get tasks
done as quickly, because they may not feel the pressure and anxiety
needed to get tasks done until later, and they may not do things in a
straightforward, strategic fashion. This may cause them some
distress.</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br> The point is, everyone has different kinds of skills that
contribute to their style, and for everyone, their style will be both a
strength and a weakness.</p>
<p>In this class, we will have group based activities. As you work on
these activities together, be aware of what your strengths are. Are you
good at creative thinking? Are you good at systematically finding good
research and references? Are you good at planning out clear responses?
Are you good at directing and managing a group in its tasks?</p>
<p>When working in your groups, <strong>let people know what your
strengths are</strong>, and try to stick with tasks that are better
suited to your strengths. Not everyone is a leader, and that’s okay. But
also, leadership demands can vary by context, so you may find that you
are well suited for a leadership role in one context but not
another.</p>
<p>And always, be patient with your group members who are different from
you. Remember, we need every style in this world, and although you might
currently find yourself in a context where your strengths might shine,
there will be another where you will need your group member’s
strength.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you find yourself struggling on one of the tasks,
because it’s doesn’t meet your strength – hang in there. We all will
have this, and your moment too will come.</p>

<div id="wellbeing" class="section level1">
<h1>Wellbeing</h1>
<p>Sometimes in this class we will discuss trauma, mental and physical
health problems, and other topics that may be sensitive to you.
Sometimes it will be clear that we will be discussing this ahead of time
and you can plan/prepare, but other times it will simply be part of the
course content, or may rise naturally as part of discussions.</p>
<p>If you are aware of certain topics ahead of time and you are
concerned that these may be difficult for you, I would encourage you to
speak to me about this and we can think of a plan to help you get the
course content you need whilst managing the sensitivities you might
have.</p>
<p>Also, I would encourage you, where and when you are comfortable doing
so – to:</p>
<p>A. Try to expose yourself in a safe and comfortable fashion to
distressing content (i.e., if your distress is above a 6 or 7 on a 0-10
scale, this may require additional steps being taken) B. Where
comfortable for you, discuss your feelings with safe and trusted friends
and family members. However, please be sure to talk to people who you
trust.</p>
